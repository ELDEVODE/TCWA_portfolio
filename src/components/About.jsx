              Our mission is to bring balance to two major stereotyped extremist
              in Africa; The sociocultural norms and practices that limit the
              participation and empowerment of women and the self limiting
              mindset these norms have instilled in the lives of most African
              women resulting to a mediocre way of life.

              The second goal is achieved by addressing the sociocultural
              limitations from the grassroots. TCW Africa is working closely
              with communities, traditional and religious authorities to change
              sociocultural norms that have limited the participation of girls
              through literal community dialogues, targeted outreaches and
              social media campaigns that will educate the community members on
              the benefits of letting a girl pursue her dreams and empowering
              women.
